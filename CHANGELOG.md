# KATO Changelog

## [Latest] - 2024-12-22 (Updated)

### Fixed
- Corrected test understanding of KATO prediction fields:
  - `future` field contains events after present (not `missing`)
  - `missing` field contains symbols expected within present events but not observed
  - `present` field includes all contiguous matching events
  - Empty events are properly ignored
- Updated 8 existing tests to correctly check prediction fields
- Fixed test assertions to properly validate temporal segmentation

### Added (Additional)
- **test_prediction_fields.py**: 11 comprehensive tests for prediction field semantics
- **test_prediction_edge_cases.py**: 10 edge case tests for boundary conditions
- **test_empty_events_in_sequence**: Verifies empty events are ignored
- Detailed documentation of KATO's prediction structure
- Examples showing correct usage of past/present/future/missing/extras fields

## [Previous] - 2024-12-22

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite with 76+ tests covering unit, integration, and API functionality
- Test documentation in TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Helper functions for KATO's alphanumeric sorting behavior
- Specific test suite for sorting behavior verification
- Test fixtures for hash verification and deterministic testing

### Changed
- Updated all tests to account for KATO's alphanumeric sorting within events
- Renamed kato-tests-v2 to kato-tests as the primary test suite
- Enhanced README.md with testing section

### Test Suite Features
- **Unit Tests (44 tests)**:
  - Observations processing
  - Memory management
  - Model hashing with MODEL| prefix
  - Predictions and scoring
  - Sorting behavior verification

- **Integration Tests (11 tests)**:
  - End-to-end sequence learning
  - Context switching
  - Multi-modal processing
  - Branching sequences

- **API Tests (21 tests)**:
  - REST endpoint validation
  - Error handling
  - Protocol compliance

### Test Suite Structure
- **98 total tests** across unit, integration, and API categories
- **Unit Tests (66)**: Core functionality and behavior verification
- **Integration Tests (11)**: End-to-end sequence learning scenarios  
- **API Tests (21)**: REST endpoint validation and protocol compliance

### Key Improvements
- Tests now properly handle KATO's alphanumeric sorting of strings within events
- Added deterministic hash verification for MODEL| and VECTOR| prefixes
- Comprehensive documentation of KATO's unique behaviors
- Test helpers for automatic sorting in assertions

### Technical Details

#### Core Behaviors
- **Alphanumeric Sorting**: Strings sorted within events, event order preserved
- **Deterministic Hashing**: All models receive MODEL|<sha1_hash> names
- **Empty Event Handling**: Empty observations ignored, don't change state
- **Temporal Segmentation**: Sophisticated past/present/future prediction structure

#### Prediction Fields
- **past**: Events before the current matching state
- **present**: Contiguous events identified by matching symbols (supports partial matches)
- **future**: Events after the present state  
- **missing**: Expected symbols not observed within present events
- **extras**: Observed symbols not expected in present events

#### Test Infrastructure
- Docker containers with automatic setup/teardown
- Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Comprehensive fixtures and helper utilities
- Automatic sorting validation for assertions
