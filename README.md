## What is KATO?

KATO is a specialized AI module that provides **deterministic memory, abstraction, and recall** for modern agentic AI systems. It learns patterns from observations and makes temporal predictions with complete transparency and traceability.

### Pattern-Based Learning

KATO uses **patterns** as its core learning concept:
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-ordered patterns with temporal dependencies
- **Profile Patterns**: Collections without temporal ordering requirements

Every learned structure in KATO is identified by a unique hash: `PTRN|<sha1_hash>`

**Important**: Patterns require at least 2 strings total to generate predictions. When learning patterns, frequency starts at 1 and increments with each re-learning of the same pattern.

### Key Features

‚ú® **Deterministic Learning** - Same inputs always yield same outputs  
üîç **Full Transparency** - All internal states and decisions are explainable  
üéØ **Temporal Predictions** - Sophisticated past/present/future segmentation  
üß† **Multi-Modal Support** - Process text, vectors, and emotional context  
‚ö° **High Performance** - FastAPI async architecture with embedded processors  
üîÑ **Stateful Processing** - Maintains context across observations  
üöÄ **Multi-Instance Support** - Run multiple processors with different configurations  
üìä **Instance Isolation** - Each processor_id has completely isolated databases  
üé™ **Vector Database** - Modern vector search with Qdrant (10-100x faster)  

### Example Architecture

![KATO Agent](assets/kato-agent.png "KATO agent")

Combining KATO with black box stochastic processes such as General Purpose Transformer (GPT) models, Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and GPT-based reasoning models provides a layer of governance and control. These stochastic machine learning models suffer from issues like hallucinations, inconsistent outputs, hidden biases, high training and operational costs, and no assurances for guardrails or remediation attempts.

KATO provides a deterministic machine learning algorithm that learns context + action + outcome patterns, effectively caching for reduced calls to expensive models. Additionally, it stores these patterns in a traceable database (typically MongoDB) allowing both real-time learning and updates. If an action taken by the agent needs to be corrected so that it isn't repeated given the same or similar context, the database can simply be edited with an alternative action.


## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- MongoDB (auto-started with Docker)
- Qdrant Vector Database (auto-started with Docker)

### Required Python Packages (for development)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Build
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kato.git
cd kato

# Build Docker image
./kato-manager.sh build
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
# Start all services (MongoDB, Qdrant, and 3 KATO instances)
./kato-manager.sh start

# Services will be available at:
# - Primary KATO: http://localhost:8001
# - Testing KATO: http://localhost:8002
# - Analytics KATO: http://localhost:8003
# - MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017
# - Qdrant: http://localhost:6333
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check health of primary instance
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Response:
# {"status": "healthy", "processor_id": "primary", "uptime": 123.45}

# Check API documentation
# Open in browser: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

### 4. Basic Usage
```bash
# Send observation to primary instance
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/observe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "strings": ["hello", "world"],
    "vectors": [],
    "emotives": {"joy": 0.8},
    "unique_id": "obs-123"  # Optional unique identifier
  }'

# Learn pattern from current STM
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/learn
# Returns: {"pattern_name": "PTRN|<hash>", "processor_id": "...", "message": "..."}

# Get predictions
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/predictions
# Or with specific observation ID:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/predictions?unique_id=obs-123"
```

## Core Concepts

KATO processes observations as **events** containing strings, vectors, and emotives. Each event is processed through:
- **Alphanumeric sorting** within events
- **Deterministic hashing** for patterns (PTRN|<sha1_hash>)
- **Temporal segmentation** in predictions
- **Empty event filtering**
- **Minimum requirement**: 2+ strings in STM for predictions (vectors contribute strings)

Learn more in [Core Concepts](docs/CONCEPTS.md).

## Service Management

### Starting and Stopping
```bash
# Start all services
./kato-manager.sh start

# Stop all services
./kato-manager.sh stop

# Restart services
./kato-manager.sh restart

# Check status
./kato-manager.sh status
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Primary
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Testing
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Analytics

# View logs
./kato-manager.sh logs          # All services
./kato-manager.sh logs primary  # Specific service
docker logs kato-primary --tail 50  # Direct Docker logs
```

## Testing

KATO uses a simplified test architecture where tests run in local Python and connect to running services:

### Prerequisites for Testing
```bash
# Services must be running first
./kato-manager.sh start

# Set up Python environment (one-time setup)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (services must be running)
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop

# Run specific test suite
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/unit/
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/integration/
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/api/

# Run specific test file
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/unit/test_sorting_behavior.py

# Run with verbose output
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop -v tests/tests/unit/

# Run tests with fresh KATO (slower but cleaner)
./run_tests.sh  # Will start/stop KATO automatically
```

### Test Architecture
- **No Docker in Tests**: Tests run in local Python, connect to running KATO service
- **Automatic Isolation**: Each test gets unique processor_id for complete isolation
- **Fast Iteration**: Direct Python execution allows debugging with print/breakpoints
- **Parallel Safe**: Tests can run in parallel thanks to processor_id isolation

**Current Status**: 185 total tests (184 passing, 1 intentionally skipped) across unit, integration, API, and performance suites

See [Testing Guide](docs/TESTING.md) for complete details.

## Architecture Overview

### FastAPI Architecture (Current)
KATO now uses a simplified FastAPI architecture with embedded processors:

```
Client Request ‚Üí FastAPI Service (Port 8001-8003) ‚Üí Embedded KATO Processor
                           ‚Üì                                    ‚Üì
                    Async Processing                    MongoDB & Qdrant
                           ‚Üì                            (Isolated by processor_id)
                    JSON Response
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Direct Embedding**: KATO processor runs in same process as API
- **No Connection Issues**: Eliminated state management problems
- **Better Performance**: No inter-process communication overhead
- **Simpler Debugging**: Single process, clear stack traces
- **Full Async Support**: FastAPI's async capabilities for high concurrency

### Database Isolation
Each processor_id maintains complete isolation:
- **MongoDB**: Database name = processor_id (e.g., `test_123.patterns_kb`)
- **Qdrant**: Collection name = `vectors_{processor_id}`
- **In-Memory**: Per-processor caches and state

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Services can be configured via environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - PROCESSOR_ID=primary           # Unique identifier
  - PROCESSOR_NAME=Primary          # Display name
  - MONGO_BASE_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017
  - QDRANT_HOST=qdrant
  - QDRANT_PORT=6333
  - MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH=0           # 0 = manual learning only
  - PERSISTENCE=5                  # STM persistence
  - RECALL_THRESHOLD=0.1           # Pattern matching threshold
  - LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
```

### Multiple Configurations
The `docker-compose.yml` includes three pre-configured instances:
- **Primary** (8001): General use, manual learning
- **Testing** (8002): Debug logging, for development
- **Analytics** (8003): Auto-learn after 50 observations, higher recall threshold
