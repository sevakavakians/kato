# KATO
**Knowledge Abstraction for Traceable Outcomes**

> *Transparent memory and abstraction for agentic AI systems — deterministic, explainable, and emotive-aware.*

---

## 🚀 Overview
**KATO** is a specialized AI module designed to provide **deterministic memory, abstraction, and recall** for modern agentic AI systems.  
It combines:

- **Knowledge Abstraction** – Converts raw inputs into structured, higher-level representations.
- **Traceable Outcomes** – Every result is fully explainable and linked back to its source.
- **Emotive Awareness** – Captures and processes emotional context (“emotives”) alongside factual knowledge.

KATO is derived from the heritage of the **GAIuS** framework, retaining its most valuable core — a **transparent, symbolic, and physics-informed learning process** — while focusing on a single critical component:  
a **rote memorizer and abstracter** that excels at clarity, precision, and accountability.

## ✨ Features
- **Deterministic Learning** – No randomness; same inputs always yield the same outputs.
- **Full Transparency** – All internal states and transformations are inspectable.
- **Multi-Modal Support** – Works with text, vision, sensor data, and more.
- **Emotive Processing** – Associates data with emotional context when relevant.
- **Explainable Outputs** – Every abstraction and decision is linked to traceable input sequences.
