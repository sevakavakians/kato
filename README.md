## What is KATO?

KATO is a **deterministic AI architecture** that provides transparent, explainable machine learning through pattern-based learning—an alternative approach to transformer architectures for applications requiring real-time learning, complete traceability, and computational efficiency without neural networks.

As an evolution of GAIuS (winner of Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky 8th Entrepreneurial Challenge Award in 2018), KATO inherits proven sensor-fusion capabilities and adheres to **[ExCITE AI principles](https://medium.com/@sevakavakians/what-is-excite-ai-712afd372af4)** (Explainable, Correctable, Incremental, Traceable, Efficient). This makes KATO an **ExCITE-capable prediction engine** uniquely suited for safety-critical and highly regulated verticals where transparency, traceability, and real-time correction are mandatory.

While transformer-based models (GPT, Claude, LLaMA) excel at language understanding and creative generation, they come with fundamental limitations that make them unsuitable for many production AI systems. KATO fills these critical gaps by providing a **symbolic, pattern-based learning architecture** that learns incrementally, operates deterministically, and maintains complete traceability—all while running on commodity CPUs.

**KATO doesn't replace transformers—it complements them.** Use transformers for language understanding and reasoning; use KATO for deterministic memory, pattern prediction, and fact-based generation. Together, they form a powerful hybrid architecture that combines the best of both approaches.

### Modern AI's Critical Limitations

Modern AI is built on transformer architectures that suffer from critical flaws:

- ❌ **Non-Deterministic** - Same input produces different outputs (sampling, temperature)
- ❌ **Unexplainable** - Billions of weights with no interpretable meaning
- ❌ **Static Knowledge** - Cannot learn new information without expensive retraining
- ❌ **GPU-Dependent** - Requires $10k-$30k hardware for inference
- ❌ **Hallucinations** - Generates plausible but incorrect information
- ❌ **Non-Correctable** - Fixing errors requires full model retraining

### KATO's Alternative Approach

- ✅ **100% Deterministic** - Same inputs always yield identical outputs
- ✅ **Fully Transparent** - Every prediction traces to source patterns
- ✅ **Real-Time Learning** - Learns from single observations instantly
- ✅ **CPU-Optimized** - Runs on $50/month VMs, no GPUs required
- ✅ **Fact-Based** - Only predicts from observed patterns, no hallucinations
- ✅ **Database-Editable** - Fix incorrect predictions with SQL UPDATE

### Pattern-Based Learning

KATO uses **patterns** as its core learning concept:
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-ordered patterns with temporal dependencies
- **Profile Patterns**: Collections without temporal ordering requirements

Every learned structure in KATO is identified by a unique hash: `PTRN|<sha1_hash>`

## Architecture Comparison: KATO vs Transformers

Understanding when to use KATO versus transformers is critical for building effective AI systems:

| Feature | Transformers (GPT-4, Claude) | KATO | Hybrid (KATO + LLM) |
|---------|------------------------------|------|---------------------|
| **Learning** | Batch pre-training on billions of tokens | Incremental learning from single observations | LLM for language, KATO for memory |
| **Hardware** | GPUs required ($1000s/month) | CPU-only ($50/month) | Reduced LLM calls = cost savings |
| **Explainability** | Black-box attention weights | Complete pattern traceability | Transparent decisions + language interface |
| **Determinism** | Non-deterministic (sampling) | 100% deterministic | Deterministic core + reasoning fallback |
| **Knowledge Updates** | Requires retraining | Direct database edits (SQL UPDATE) | Update patterns without retraining LLM |
| **Real-time Learning** | Not possible | Instant pattern learning | Adapt in production without downtime |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Challenging (no audit trail) | Built-in (complete traceability) | Best of both worlds |
| **Startup Time** | 30-60 seconds (model loading) | 2-3 seconds | Fast initialization |
| **Memory** | 80GB+ GPU memory | 200-500MB RAM | Optimized resource usage |
| **Hallucinations** | Common (generates false info) | Impossible (fact-based only) | LLM for reasoning, KATO for facts |
| **Generation** | Creative, fluent, novel content | Fact-preserving recombination | Creativity + accuracy |

## Text Generation Without Hallucinations

### KATO-LM: Hierarchical Pattern-Based Generation

As an example use of KATO, a language model is built on it.

Unlike transformer-based language models that can generate plausible but false content ("hallucinations"), **KATO-LM generates text by sampling and unraveling actually observed patterns** from training data.

**How It Works**:
1. **Training**: Learn hierarchical patterns at multiple scales:
   - **node0**: Token chunks (15 tokens)
   - **node1**: Paragraphs (225 tokens)
   - **node2**: Chapters (3,375 tokens)
   - **node3**: Documents (50,625 tokens)

2. **Generation**: Sample high-level patterns using Markov chain probabilities, then unravel hierarchically to produce text

3. **Constraint**: Can only generate sequences that appeared (or are compositions of sequences that appeared) in training data

**Key Advantages Over Transformer Generation**:

- ✅ **Zero Hallucinations** - Cannot generate facts not present in training corpus
- ✅ **Complete Transparency** - Every generated token traceable to source pattern with frequency count
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Same seed + context → same output (fully reproducible)
- ✅ **Multi-Scale Control** - Generate at sentence, paragraph, chapter, or document level
- ✅ **Frequency-Based Sampling** - Explicit probability interpretation (pattern seen N times)

**Trade-offs**:
- Less creative than transformers (recombines learned patterns only)
- Requires training corpus to fully cover target domain
- Cannot synthesize novel facts or reasoning beyond training data

**Ideal Use Cases**:
- 🏥 Medical documentation (fact-critical, no fabrication)
- ⚖️ Legal text generation (precedent-based, traceable)
- 📊 Financial reports (accurate data reproduction)
- 🔬 Scientific writing (reproducible, explainable)
- 📋 Technical documentation (structured, pattern-based)

**Status**: Pattern learning infrastructure complete. Basic generation implemented. Advanced multi-scale sampling in active development.

## When to Use KATO vs Transformers

### Choose KATO When:

- ✅ **Explainability is mandatory** (regulatory, safety-critical, compliance)
- ✅ **Deterministic behavior required** (testing, certification, reproducibility)
- ✅ **Real-time learning needed** (adapt from observations without retraining)
- ✅ **Cost efficiency matters** (no GPU budget, edge deployment)
- ✅ **Knowledge correction valuable** (fix errors post-deployment via database edits)
- ✅ **Temporal patterns primary** (sequences, workflows, time-series)
- ✅ **Multi-tenancy required** (isolated knowledge bases per user/organization)
- ✅ **Fact-based generation** (medical, legal, financial documentation)

### Choose Transformers When:

- ✅ **Open-ended generation primary** (creative writing, code generation, brainstorming)
- ✅ **Zero-shot learning needed** (handle completely novel domains)
- ✅ **Deep semantic understanding** (natural language nuance, context, ambiguity)
- ✅ **Transfer learning valuable** (leverage massive pre-training)
- ✅ **Fluency critical** (human-like text generation)

### Choose Hybrid Architecture (KATO + Transformer) When:

🤝 **Best of Both Worlds**:
- Natural language interface (transformer) + transparent decision-making (KATO)
- Language understanding (transformer) + deterministic memory (KATO)
- Creative reasoning (transformer) + fact-based generation (KATO)
- Reduced costs (LLM only when needed, KATO for pattern recall)
- Regulatory compliance (KATO audit trails) + user experience (LLM fluency)

**Hybrid Architecture Pattern**:
```
Natural Language Input
         ↓
   LLM (Language Understanding) ← Semantic comprehension, reasoning
         ↓
   KATO (Pattern Memory) ← Deterministic recall, fact-based prediction
         ↓
   Decision Engine ← Transparent, traceable actions
         ↓
   Action Execution
```

**Production Example**:
- **Customer Support Bot**: LLM understands user intent → KATO recalls relevant cases/solutions → LLM generates natural response
- **Medical Diagnosis Assistant**: LLM processes symptoms → KATO matches symptom patterns → LLM explains diagnosis (with full traceability)
- **Financial Advisory**: LLM understands client goals → KATO predicts portfolio patterns → LLM communicates recommendations

## KATO for Regulated Verticals & Safety-Critical Systems

### Why Highly Regulated Industries Choose KATO

In domains where errors have serious consequences—healthcare, aerospace, defense, finance, manufacturing—AI systems must meet stringent requirements that transformer-based models simply cannot satisfy. KATO was specifically designed for these demanding environments.

```python
# Aerospace: Multi-sensor anomaly detection
observe([
    ["altitude|3500", "speed|250", "temp|normal"],  # Flight data
    ["VCTR|image_embed_123"],                       # Vision system
    ["vibration|0.2", "fuel|80pct"]                # Sensor readings
])
predictions = get_predictions()  # Detects patterns indicating maintenance needs

# Healthcare: Patient monitoring
observe([
    ["heart_rate|95", "bp|normal", "temp|98.6"],   # Vital signs
    ["patient_restless", "night_shift"],            # Nurse observations
    ["VCTR|ecg_pattern_456"]                        # ECG embedding
])
predictions = get_predictions()  # Predicts patient deterioration risks
```

### Transparent Predictions with Real-Time Correction

**Production Scenario: Medical Device Monitoring**
```bash
# Initial pattern learned from device behavior
Context: ["device|XR100", "temp|rising", "vibration|high"]

### Hybrid AI Architecture: The Future of Production Systems

![KATO Agent](assets/kato-agent.png "KATO agent")

**Combining KATO with transformer-based models creates a powerful hybrid architecture** that addresses the fundamental limitations of pure neural approaches while maintaining the benefits of natural language understanding.

#### The Problem with Pure Transformer Systems

Black-box stochastic processes like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and GPT-based reasoning models suffer from critical issues:

- **Hallucinations**: Generate plausible but incorrect information without indication
- **Inconsistent Outputs**: Same input produces different outputs (non-deterministic)
- **Hidden Biases**: Learned biases from training data without transparency
- **High Training Costs**: Billions of dollars for large-scale pre-training
- **High Operational Costs**: GPU inference at scale is expensive
- **No Guardrails**: Cannot guarantee outputs stay within acceptable bounds
- **No Remediation**: Fixing errors requires expensive retraining cycles

#### KATO's Solution: Deterministic Memory Layer

KATO provides a **deterministic pattern-based learning layer** that learns context + action + outcome patterns, effectively:

1. **Caching for Reduced LLM Calls**: Store proven patterns for instant recall (orders of magnitude faster + cheaper)
2. **Traceable Database Storage**: All patterns stored in ClickHouse with complete audit trails
3. **Real-Time Learning**: Adapt to new patterns instantly without retraining
4. **Database-Editable Knowledge**: If an action needs correction, simply edit the pattern in the database—changes take effect immediately

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# Pattern learned from experience
Context: ["user_frustrated", "payment_failed", "mobile_app"]
Action: ["escalate_to_human", "offer_refund"]
Outcome: ["issue_resolved", "satisfaction_score_9"]

# If action proves incorrect, fix with SQL:
UPDATE patterns_data
SET pattern_data = [['new', 'correct', 'action']]
WHERE kb_id = 'production' AND name = 'pattern_hash';

# Next time same context appears → corrected action (no retraining)
```

#### Key Benefits of Hybrid Architecture

- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Use LLM only for language understanding, KATO for memory/prediction (10-100x cost reduction)
- ✅ **Transparency**: Every decision traceable to source patterns (regulatory compliance)
- ✅ **Adaptability**: Learn from production experience in real-time
- ✅ **Guardrails**: Pattern-based constraints prevent harmful outputs
- ✅ **Remediation**: Fix errors via database edits, no retraining cycles
- ✅ **Best UX**: Natural language interface (LLM) + reliable memory (KATO)

```

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Using Pre-Built Container Images (Recommended)

KATO provides official pre-built container images hosted on GitHub Container Registry. This is the fastest way to get started.

#### Available Image Tags

| Tag | Description | Use Case |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| `2.0.0` | Specific version (immutable) | Production - pin to exact version |
| `2.0` | Latest patch for 2.0.x | Auto-receive security/bug fixes |
| `2` | Latest minor for 2.x | Track major version |
| `latest` | Latest stable release | Development and testing |

#### Pull Pre-Built Image

```bash
# Recommended for production - pin to specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/sevakavakians/kato:2.0.0

# Auto-receive patch updates (security fixes, bug fixes)
docker pull ghcr.io/sevakavakians/kato:2.0

# Always use latest stable (for development)
docker pull ghcr.io/sevakavakians/kato:latest
```

#### Use with Docker Compose

Modify your `docker compose.yml` to use pre-built images:

```yaml
services:
  kato:
    image: ghcr.io/sevakavakians/kato:2.0.0  # Use pre-built image
    # Remove 'build' section
    container_name: kato
    environment:
      - SERVICE_NAME=kato
      # ... rest of environment variables
```

See the [Standalone Deployment Guide](deployment/README.md) for complete instructions on using pre-built images.

### Option 2: Build from Source

If you need to modify the code or contribute to development, build from source.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kato.git
cd kato
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
# Start all services (includes ClickHouse, Qdrant, Redis, KATO)
./start.sh

# Services will be available at:
# - KATO Service: http://localhost:8000
# - ClickHouse: http://localhost:8123
# - Qdrant: http://localhost:6333
# - Redis: redis://localhost:6379
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Response:
# {"status": "healthy", "session_id": "default", "uptime": 123.45}

# Quick test of basic functionality
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/api/test_fastapi_endpoints.py::test_health_endpoint -v

# Check API documentation
# Open in browser: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 4. Basic Usage

#### Option A: Using Sessions (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a session for node isolation
SESSION=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"node_id": "alice"}' | jq -r '.session_id')

# Observe in isolated session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/$SESSION/observe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strings": ["hello", "world"]}'

# Get session's isolated STM
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/$SESSION/stm
```

**💾 Data Persistence Note:**
- Your `node_id` ("alice") is your **persistent identifier** - using the same `node_id` later will reconnect to all trained patterns
- Sessions (STM, emotives) are temporary and expire, but learned patterns in ClickHouse persist forever
- See [Database Persistence Guide](docs/users/database-persistence.md) for complete details

#### Option B: Default Session API (backwards compatible)
```bash
# Send observation (backward compatible)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/observe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "strings": ["hello", "world"],
    "vectors": [],
    "emotives": {"joy": 0.8},
    "unique_id": "obs-123"  # Optional unique identifier
  }'

# Learn pattern from current STM
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/learn
# Returns: {"pattern_name": "PTRN|<hash>", "session_id": "...", "message": "..."}

# Get predictions
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/predictions
# Or with specific observation ID:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/predictions?unique_id=obs-123"
```

## Core Concepts

KATO processes observations as **events** containing strings, vectors, and emotives. Each event is processed through:
- **Alphanumeric sorting** within events
- **Deterministic hashing** for patterns (PTRN|<sha1_hash>)
- **Temporal segmentation** in predictions
- **Empty event filtering**
- **Minimum requirement**: 2+ strings in STM for predictions (vectors contribute strings)

Learn more in [Core Concepts](docs/developers/concepts.md) or [User Guide](docs/users/concepts.md).

## Service Management

### Starting and Stopping
```bash
# Start all services
./start.sh

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Check status
docker compose ps
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash

docker logs kato --tail 50         # Direct Docker logs
```

## Testing

KATO uses a simplified test architecture where tests run in local Python and connect to running services:

### Prerequisites for Testing
```bash
# Services must be running first
./start.sh

# Set up Python environment (one-time setup)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests
```bash

./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/integration/
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/api/

# Run specific test file
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/unit/test_sorting_behavior.py

# Run with verbose output
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop -v tests/tests/unit/

# Run tests with fresh KATO (slower but cleaner)
./run_tests.sh  # Will start/stop services automatically
```

### Test Architecture
- **No Docker in Tests**: Tests run in local Python, connect to running KATO service
- **Automatic Isolation**: Each test gets unique processor_id for complete isolation
- **Fast Iteration**: Direct Python execution allows debugging with print/breakpoints
- **Parallel Safe**: Tests can run in parallel thanks to processor_id isolation

**Current Status**: 185 total tests (184 passing, 1 intentionally skipped) across unit, integration, API, and performance suites

## Architecture Overview

### FastAPI Architecture (Current)
KATO uses a simplified FastAPI architecture with embedded processors:

```
Client Request → FastAPI Service (Port 8000) → Embedded KATO Processor
                           ↓                                    ↓
                    Async Processing              ClickHouse, Qdrant & Redis
                           ↓                       (Isolated by session_id)
                    JSON Response
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Direct Embedding**: KATO processor runs in same process as API
- **No Connection Issues**: Eliminated state management problems
- **Better Performance**: No inter-process communication overhead
- **Simpler Debugging**: Single process, clear stack traces
- **Full Async Support**: FastAPI's async capabilities for high concurrency

### Session Isolation
Each session maintains complete isolation:
- **Redis**: Session state isolated by session_id
- **ClickHouse**: Patterns isolated by kb_id partitioning
- **Qdrant**: Vectors isolated by session collection
- **In-Memory**: Per-session caches and state

## Configuration

KATO uses environment variables for configuration with Pydantic-based validation.

### Key Configuration Parameters

```bash
# Database
CLICKHOUSE_HOST="localhost"
CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123
CLICKHOUSE_DB="kato"
QDRANT_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"

# Learning
MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH=0        # Auto-learn after N observations (0=manual)
RECALL_THRESHOLD=0.1        # Pattern matching threshold (0.0-1.0)
PERSISTENCE=5               # Emotive value window size
STM_MODE="CLEAR"            # STM mode after auto-learn (CLEAR/ROLLING)

# Processing
MAX_PREDICTIONS=100         # Maximum predictions to return
PROCESS_PREDICTIONS=true    # Enable prediction processing
RANK_SORT_ALGO="potential"  # Prediction ranking metric

# Sessions
SESSION_TTL=3600            # Session time-to-live (seconds)
SESSION_AUTO_EXTEND=true    # Auto-extend TTL on access

# API
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"            # Logging level
PORT=8000                   # API port
```

### Session Configuration

Each session can have independent configuration:

```bash
# Update session config
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/{session_id}/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"config": {"recall_threshold": 0.5, "max_predictions": 50}}'
```

For complete configuration details, see [Configuration Guide](docs/operations/configuration.md).

## API Reference

### Quick Start

> **⚠️ All operations require session-based endpoints** (Phase 3 migration complete).

```bash
# 1. Create session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"node_id": "user_alice"}'

# 2. Observe
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/{session_id}/observe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strings": ["hello", "world"]}'

# 3. Learn pattern
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sessions/{session_id}/learn

# 4. Get predictions
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions/{session_id}/predictions
```

### Key Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/sessions` | POST | Create new session |
| `/sessions/{id}/observe` | POST | Add observation |
| `/sessions/{id}/learn` | POST | Learn pattern |
| `/sessions/{id}/predictions` | GET | Get predictions |
| `/sessions/{id}/stm` | GET | View STM |
| `/sessions/{id}/config` | POST | Update config |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/metrics` | GET | Performance metrics |

## Performance

### Current Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: 1-5ms per observation
- **Throughput**: 5,000+ requests/second per instance
- **Memory**: 200MB-500MB per processor
- **Startup Time**: 2-3 seconds
- **Vector Search**: 10-100x faster with Qdrant

### Scaling
- **Vertical**: Increase resources for individual containers
- **Horizontal**: Run multiple KATO instances on different ports
- **Load Balancing**: Use nginx or similar for distributing requests

See [Performance Guide](docs/technical/PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :8123
lsof -i :6333
lsof -i :6379

# Clean restart
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

#### Tests Failing
```bash
# Ensure services are running
docker compose ps

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Check Docker resources
docker system df
docker system prune -f

# Restart with fresh state
docker compose down
docker volume prune -f
./start.sh
```

#### ClickHouse Init Container Exits After Startup
**This is expected behavior.** The `clickhouse-init` container is designed to:
1. Start up when ClickHouse is ready
2. Initialize the ClickHouse database schema
3. Exit successfully (with status code 0)
4. Remain in "Exited" state

This is an initialization container that only needs to run once. You can verify it completed successfully:
```bash
# Check exit status (should show "Exited (0)")
docker ps -a | grep clickhouse-init

# View initialization logs
docker logs kato-clickhouse-init
```

The main ClickHouse container (`kato-clickhouse`) will continue running normally. Only the init container stops after completing its setup task.

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/technical/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more solutions.

## Heritage

KATO is derived from the [GAIuS](https://medium.com/@sevakavakians/what-is-gaius-a-responsible-alternative-to-neural-network-artificial-intelligence-part-1-of-3-1f7bbe583a32) framework, which won **Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky 8th Entrepreneurial Challenge Award in 2018** for its unique sensor-fusion capabilities. KATO retains GAIuS's transparent, symbolic, and physics-informed learning process while focusing on deterministic memory and abstraction for production AI systems.

### Award-Winning Sensor Fusion

The 2018 Lockheed Martin Sikorsky award recognized GAIuS's breakthrough approach to integrating multiple sensor streams—vision systems, telemetry, audio, and environmental data—into a unified, explainable prediction framework. KATO inherits and extends these proven capabilities, making it uniquely suited for mission-critical applications in aerospace, defense, healthcare, and industrial IoT.

### ExCITE AI Principles

Like GAIuS before it, KATO adheres to [ExCITE AI](https://medium.com/@sevakavakians/what-is-excite-ai-712afd372af4) principles:
- **Explainable** - Every prediction traceable to source patterns
- **Correctable** - Real-time knowledge updates via database edits
- **Incremental** - Learn from single observations instantly
- **Traceable** - Complete audit trails for regulatory compliance
- **Efficient** - CPU-only operation, no GPU requirements
