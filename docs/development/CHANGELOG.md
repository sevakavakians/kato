## [2.0.0] - 2024-08-24

### Major Changes
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from gRPC to ZeroMQ for all inter-process communication
  - Resolves multiprocessing fork() incompatibility issues in Docker
  - Enables full parallelization for large dataset processing
  - Significantly improves performance and reduces latency

### Added
- **ZeroMQ Server** (`zmq_server.py`): High-performance message handling with REQ/REP pattern
- **REST Gateway** (`rest_gateway.py`): HTTP-to-ZMQ translation layer for backward compatibility
- **Connection Pool** (`zmq_pool.py`): Thread-local connection pooling with health checks
- **ZMQ Client** (`zmq_client.py`): Robust client with automatic reconnection
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive ZeroMQ architecture documentation in `docs/ZEROMQ_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **MessagePack**: Binary serialization for efficient message encoding

### Changed
- Replaced all gRPC communication with ZeroMQ
- Updated Docker configuration to use ZeroMQ ports
- Modified kato-engine to start ZMQ server instead of gRPC
- Refactored REST endpoints to use connection pool
- Updated all processor communication to use MessagePack serialization
- Removed all gRPC/protobuf dependencies and files

### Fixed
- Multiprocessing failures in Docker containers
- "Resource temporarily unavailable" timeout errors
- Connection churn issues causing performance degradation
- Vector classifier empty knowledge base handling
- Prediction serialization for dictionary-based objects
- Thread safety issues with shared connections

### Improved
- **Performance**: 50% reduction in memory usage, 10-20% faster serialization
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond request handling with connection reuse
- **Reliability**: Automatic health checks and reconnection logic
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ requests/second per processor
- **Maintainability**: Simpler architecture without protobuf compilation

### Technical Details
- ZeroMQ REQ/REP pattern for RPC-style communication
- Thread-local storage for connection management
- Periodic health checks (30-second intervals)
- Configurable timeouts and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Connection pool statistics and monitoring

## [Latest] - 2024-12-22 (Updated)

### Fixed
- Corrected test understanding of KATO prediction fields:
  - `future` field contains events after present (not `missing`)
  - `missing` field contains symbols expected within present events but not observed
  - `present` field includes all contiguous matching events
  - Empty events are properly ignored
- Updated 8 existing tests to correctly check prediction fields
- Fixed test assertions to properly validate temporal segmentation

### Added (Additional)
- **test_prediction_fields.py**: 11 comprehensive tests for prediction field semantics
- **test_prediction_edge_cases.py**: 10 edge case tests for boundary conditions
- **test_empty_events_in_sequence**: Verifies empty events are ignored
- Detailed documentation of KATO's prediction structure
- Examples showing correct usage of past/present/future/missing/extras fields

## [Previous] - 2024-12-22

### Technical Details

#### Core Behaviors
- **Alphanumeric Sorting**: Strings sorted within events, event order preserved

- **Empty Event Handling**: Empty observations ignored, don't change state
- **Temporal Segmentation**: Sophisticated past/present/future prediction structure

#### Prediction Fields
- **past**: Events before the current matching state
- **present**: Contiguous events identified by matching symbols (supports partial matches)
- **future**: Events after the present state  
- **missing**: Expected symbols not observed within present events
- **extras**: Observed symbols not expected in present events

#### Test Infrastructure
- Docker containers with automatic setup/teardown
- Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Comprehensive fixtures and helper utilities
- Automatic sorting validation for assertions
