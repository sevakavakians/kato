## FAQ

### Q: Can I test GPU code on macOS?
**A:** No. CUDA requires Linux or Windows. macOS has no CUDA support, even with NVIDIA eGPU.

### Q: What about Apple Silicon GPU (Metal)?
**A:** Different API (Metal vs CUDA). Would require complete rewrite of kernels. Not recommended.

### Q: Can I use Google Colab for free GPU?
**A:** Possible but limited:
- ‚úÖ Free GPU access (T4)
- ‚ùå Session timeout (12 hours max)
- ‚ùå No persistent storage
- ‚ùå Limited to notebooks (not full dev)
- **Verdict:** Good for prototyping, not full Phase 3 development

### Q: How long is Phase 3 implementation?
**A:** ~52 hours of active development (1-2 weeks calendar time with 4-8 hours/day)

### Q: What if Phase 2 is fast enough?
**A:** Valid decision to defer Phase 3. Monitor real-world performance. GPU acceleration is "nice-to-have" not "must-have" if Phase 2 meets requirements.

### Q: Can I use Windows instead of Linux?
**A:** Yes, CUDA supports Windows. However:
- Linux is better tested
- Docker GPU support simpler on Linux
- Most examples/docs assume Linux
- **Verdict:** Possible but harder

### Q: What about AMD GPUs (ROCm)?
**A:** Would require rewriting for ROCm instead of CUDA. Not recommended for this project. CUDA ecosystem is more mature.
