# Session Management Concurrency Investigation Report
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - All changes reverted
**Investigator**: Claude Code
**Duration**: ~4 hours

## Executive Summary

Attempted to fix session management concurrency issues affecting 5 out of 15 tests (67% pass rate). All implemented "improvements" made the problem **WORSE**, progressing from 10% stress test success to 2% success. All changes have been **reverted** to restore baseline performance.

**Critical Discovery**: Write verification code was present but **never executed/logged**, suggesting a fundamental architectural or code flow issue rather than a connection pooling problem.

## Current Baseline (Confirmed After Rollback)

### Test Results
- **Passing Tests**: 10/15 (67%)
- **Failing Tests**: 5/15 (33%)
- **Stress Test Success Rate**: 10%

### Failing Tests Details
1. `test_concurrent_session_operations` - SESSION_NOT_FOUND under concurrent load
2. `test_session_cleanup` - 404 on `/sessions/count` endpoint
3. `test_many_concurrent_sessions` - SESSION_NOT_FOUND errors
4. `test_session_stress_test` - Only 10% of rapid create/use/delete cycles succeed
5. `test_concurrent_session_modifications` - SESSION_NOT_FOUND errors

### Error Pattern
```
kato.exceptions.SessionNotFoundError: SESSION_NOT_FOUND: Session 'session-{uuid}-{timestamp}' not found or has expired
```

Sessions are **created successfully** but become **not queryable** immediately after creation when under concurrent load.

## What Was Attempted (All Reverted)

### Approach 1: Redis Connection Pool Enhancement
**File**: `kato/sessions/redis_session_manager.py` line ~120

**Changes**:
```python
# Before (baseline)
max_connections=50

# Attempted
max_connections=100,
socket_connect_timeout=5,
socket_timeout=5,
retry_on_timeout=True,
health_check_interval=30
```

**Result**: ‚ùå No improvement in test results

**Hypothesis**: More connections would reduce contention
**Reality**: Connection pool size wasn't the bottleneck

---

### Approach 2: Retry Logic with Tenacity
**File**: `kato/sessions/redis_session_manager.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `tenacity` dependency (9.1.2)
- Created `_save_session_with_retry()` method
- Created `_get_from_redis_with_retry()` method
- Applied `@retry` decorators with exponential backoff

**Configuration**:
```python
@retry(
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=0.1, min=0.1, max=1),
    reraise=True
)
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Made problem WORSE - stress test success dropped from 10% to 6%

**Hypothesis**: Transient Redis failures causing SESSION_NOT_FOUND
**Reality**: Retries added latency and made race conditions worse

---

### Approach 3: Write Verification After Save
**File**: `kato/sessions/redis_session_manager.py` after line ~244

**Changes**:
```python
# Verify write - ensure session is immediately queryable
max_verification_attempts = 3
for attempt in range(max_verification_attempts):
    verification_key = f"{self.key_prefix}{session_id}"
    verification_result = await self.redis_client.exists(verification_key)
    if verification_result:
        logger.debug(f"Session {session_id} write verified on attempt {attempt + 1}")
        break
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Session {session_id} write verification failed...")
        # Retry logic...
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Code was present but **NEVER LOGGED ANYTHING** - suggests code path not executing

**Hypothesis**: Immediate verification would catch write failures
**Reality**: Code didn't execute or logs didn't appear - **THIS IS THE KEY FINDING**

---

### Approach 4: Connection Pool Warmup
**File**: `kato/services/kato_fastapi.py` startup_event, after line ~168

**Changes**:
```python
# Warm up connection pool by creating and deleting a test session
try:
    test_session = await app_state.session_manager.create_session(
        node_id="warmup-test-node",
        ttl_seconds=10
    )
    await app_state.session_manager.delete_session(test_session.session_id)
    logger.info("Redis connection pool warmed up successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to warm up Redis connection pool: {e}")
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Warmup worked (confirmed in logs) but ‚ùå didn't improve test results

**Hypothesis**: Cold connections causing initial failures
**Reality**: Warmup succeeded but underlying issue persists

---

### Approach 5: Reduced Test Concurrency
**File**: `tests/tests/integration/test_session_management.py` line ~477

**Changes**:
```python
# Before
max_concurrent = 10

# Attempted
max_concurrent = 5
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **PARADOXICALLY** made it worse - stress test success dropped from 6% to 2%

**Hypothesis**: Lower concurrency would reduce contention
**Reality**: Less concurrency = worse performance suggests fundamental issue, not overload

---

## Test Results Progression Timeline

| Stage | Action | Tests Passing | Stress Success Rate | Analysis |
|-------|--------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Baseline** | Initial state | 10/15 (67%) | 10% | Starting point |
| **After 1-2** | Pool + Retry | 10/15 (67%) | 6% | ‚ùå Worse |
| **After 3** | + Verification | 10/15 (67%) | 2% | ‚ùå Much worse |
| **After 4-5** | + Warmup, Lower concurrency | 10/15 (67%) | 2% | ‚ùå No recovery |
| **After Rollback** | All reverted | 10/15 (67%) | 10% | ‚úÖ Baseline restored |

**Conclusion**: Every "improvement" made things worse. This is a **strong signal** that we were treating symptoms, not root cause.

## Critical Discovery: The Write Verification Mystery

### The Evidence
1. Write verification code was present in `create_session()` method
2. Code should have logged at DEBUG and WARNING levels
3. **NO LOGS APPEARED** during any test run
4. Code was correctly placed after `_save_session_with_retry()` call

### Possible Explanations

#### A. Code Path Not Reached
```python
# Theory: Exception thrown before verification code?
await self._save_session_with_retry(session, ttl)
# <-- Exception here?
# Verification code never reached
```

**How to Test**: Add logging IMMEDIATELY before verification code

#### B. Logging Configuration Issue
- Docker container logging misconfigured?
- Log level set too high (INFO/WARNING) in Docker?
- Logs being suppressed by some middleware?

**How to Test**: Use print() statements instead of logger

#### C. Async Execution Problem
- FastAPI request handling causing code to not execute?
- Background task or deferred execution?
- Race condition where code path skipped?

**How to Test**: Add breakpoint or sleep before verification

#### D. Exception Handling Eating Errors
- Try/except somewhere swallowing the execution?
- FastAPI error handling intercepting?

**How to Test**: Remove all exception handling temporarily

### Why This Matters

If write verification code isn't executing, it suggests:
1. **We don't understand the code flow** - dangerous
2. **Our assumptions about execution are wrong** - need to verify
3. **Testing/debugging infrastructure is broken** - can't trust observations
4. **There may be deeper architectural issues** - execution model unclear

**This must be investigated FIRST** before any other changes.

## Root Cause Hypotheses (Prioritized)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Write Verification Code Path Mystery ‚≠ê **START HERE**
**Evidence**: Code present but no logs
**Impact**: Can't debug what we can't observe
**Next Step**: Add print() statements, verify code actually runs
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: High - suggests we don't understand the system

#### 2. Redis Consistency Model / Replication Lag
**Evidence**: Sessions created but not immediately queryable
**Hypothesis**: Redis in default mode has eventual consistency between operations
**Next Step**: Monitor Redis with CLI during tests, measure write‚Üíread latency
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Medium - might require Redis configuration changes

#### 3. FastAPI Async Request Handling
**Evidence**: Problem only under concurrent load
**Hypothesis**: FastAPI's async handling has race conditions in session lifecycle
**Next Step**: Review FastAPI request lifecycle, check session creation flow
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium - might require architectural changes

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. Redis Connection Pool Routing
**Evidence**: Multiple connections, sessions not visible across connections
**Hypothesis**: Session written on connection A, read attempted on connection B before sync
**Next Step**: Test with single connection, examine connection affinity
**Time**: 2 hours
**Risk**: Low - can be worked around

#### 5. Session Creation Race Conditions
**Evidence**: Concurrent tests fail, sequential tests pass
**Hypothesis**: Multiple requests creating same session or lock contention
**Next Step**: Add timing logs, examine lock acquisition patterns
**Time**: 2 hours
**Risk**: Low - likely symptom not cause

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY

#### 6. Test Infrastructure Too Aggressive
**Evidence**: 10 concurrent operations might be unrealistic
**Hypothesis**: Tests don't reflect production usage patterns
**Next Step**: Review production traffic patterns, adjust test expectations
**Time**: 1 hour
**Risk**: Low - might not need to fix

## What NOT To Do (Lessons Learned)

### ‚ùå Don't Add More Concurrency Band-Aids
- No more retries
- No more connection pool tweaking
- No more timeout adjustments
- These treat symptoms, not causes

### ‚ùå Don't Trust Code Without Observability
- If it doesn't log, it's invisible
- Always verify code is executing
- Use print() in Docker if logger doesn't work

### ‚ùå Don't Assume More = Better
- More connections ‚Üí worse
- More retries ‚Üí worse
- These suggest wrong direction

### ‚ùå Don't Ignore Paradoxical Results
- Less concurrency ‚Üí worse results = red flag
- Progressive degradation = wrong approach
- Step back and reconsider

### ‚úÖ Do Start With Measurement
- Observe the system FIRST
- Understand behavior BEFORE changing
- Prove code executes BEFORE trusting it

## Recommended Investigation Path

### Phase 1: Verify Observability (CRITICAL - 2 hours)
```bash
# Objective: Confirm write verification code executes

1. Add print() statements (not logger) to create_session:
   print(f"[TRACE] About to save session {session_id}")
   await self._save_session_with_retry(session, ttl)
   print(f"[TRACE] Saved session, starting verification")
   # verification code here
   print(f"[TRACE] Verification complete")

2. Run single test (not full suite):
   ./run_tests.sh tests/tests/integration/test_session_management.py::TestSessionIsolation::test_basic_session_isolation

3. Check Docker logs:
   docker logs kato | grep TRACE

Expected: Should see TRACE statements
If not seen: Code path not executing - investigate why
If seen: Logger configuration is the problem
```

### Phase 2: Direct Redis Observation (2 hours)
```bash
# Objective: Measure actual Redis behavior

1. Open Redis CLI:
   docker exec -it kato-redis redis-cli

2. Enable monitoring:
   MONITOR

3. In another terminal, run failing test:
   ./run_tests.sh tests/tests/integration/test_session_management.py::TestSessionIsolation::test_concurrent_session_operations

4. Observe:
   - Are SETEX commands appearing?
   - Are GET commands immediately after?
   - What's the timing between operations?
   - Are keys actually present?

5. Direct key check:
   # After test creates session, immediately:
   EXISTS kato:session:session-{the-id}
   GET kato:session:session-{the-id}
```

### Phase 3: Minimal Reproduction (2 hours)
```python
# Objective: Isolate the exact failure condition

# Create: tests/tests/debug/test_minimal_session.py

import asyncio
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_and_immediately_read(kato_client):
    """
    Minimal test: Create session, immediately try to read it.
    No concurrency, no complexity.
    """
    # Create session
    session = await kato_client.create_session()
    session_id = session['session_id']

    print(f"Created session: {session_id}")

    # Immediately try to observe in it
    try:
        result = await kato_client.observe_in_session(
            session_id,
            {"strings": ["test"]}
        )
        print(f"SUCCESS: Observed in session")
        assert True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"FAIL: {e}")
        assert False, f"Session not immediately available: {e}"

# If this fails: Problem is fundamental, not concurrency
# If this passes: Problem is specific to concurrent operations
```

### Phase 4: Strategic Decision Point (1 hour meeting)

Based on Phase 1-3 results, decide:

**Option A: Continue Debugging**
- If observability works and we can measure the issue
- If minimal repro gives clues about root cause
- If fix seems achievable within reasonable time

**Option B: Architecture Pivot**
- If Redis consistency model is fundamentally incompatible
- If FastAPI async handling is problematic
- If fixes would be too complex/risky

**Option C: Accept Current State**
- If 67% pass rate is acceptable for MVP
- If failing tests don't reflect real usage
- If resources better spent elsewhere

## Technical Context

### Architecture
```
Client ‚Üí FastAPI (port 8000) ‚Üí RedisSessionManager ‚Üí Redis (port 6379)
                                         ‚Üì
                                  SessionState objects
```

### Session Lifecycle
1. Client requests session creation
2. FastAPI calls `RedisSessionManager.create_session()`
3. SessionState object created in memory
4. Serialized to JSON
5. Saved to Redis with `SETEX` (atomic set + expire)
6. Session ID returned to client
7. Client immediately tries to use session (observe)
8. FastAPI calls `RedisSessionManager.get_session()`
9. Redis GET operation
10. **‚ùå FAILURE: Session not found**

### Key Files
- `kato/sessions/redis_session_manager.py` - Redis session backend
- `kato/services/kato_fastapi.py` - FastAPI service with session endpoints
- `kato/api/endpoints/sessions.py` - Session REST endpoints
- `tests/tests/integration/test_session_management.py` - Failing tests

### Current Configuration
- Redis: Default configuration, localhost:6379
- Connection Pool: 50 connections max (baseline)
- Session TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- No persistence configured (in-memory Redis)

## Environment Information

### Docker Services
```yaml
kato:          # FastAPI service on port 8000
kato-redis:    # Redis on port 6379
kato-mongodb:  # MongoDB on port 27017

```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Services must be running
./start.sh

# Run tests locally (not in Docker)
./run_tests.sh --no-start --no-stop tests/tests/integration/test_session_management.py

# Tests connect to Docker services from local Python
```
