## 💡 Key Concepts (Quick Reference)

**Sessions**: Temporary workspaces that expire (default: 1 hour)
- Create with `node_id` to connect to persistent patterns
- Each session has isolated short-term memory
- Sessions share long-term memory per `node_id`

**Observations**: Multi-modal inputs (strings, vectors, emotions)
- Strings are alphanumerically sorted within events
- Vectors are converted to hash-based names
- Emotives provide emotional context

**Patterns**: Learned sequences from observations
- Stored permanently
- Identified by SHA1 hash
- Include frequency, emotives, and metadata

**Predictions**: KATO's forecasts based on current observations
- Structured as past/present/future segments
- Include missing/extras for gap analysis
- Ranked by potential (default) or other metrics
