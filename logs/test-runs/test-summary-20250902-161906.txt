Major Categories of Failures:

1. COMPREHENSIVE PATTERNS (10/10 failed):
   - Long sequence processing failures
   - Complex multimodal sequence issues
   - Partial observation errors
   - Memory segmentation problems

2. MEMORY MANAGEMENT (3/3 failed):
   - Short-term memory retrieval issues
   - Memory clearing functionality broken
   - Learning mechanism failures

3. OBSERVATION HANDLING (7/7 failed):  
   - Basic observation processing broken
   - Multimodal observation issues
   - Empty observation handling problems
   - Vector observation failures

4. PATTERN HASHING (1/1 failed):
   - Hash consistency issues

5. PREDICTION ENGINE (27/27 failed):
   - Core prediction logic completely broken
   - Edge case handling failures
   - Field validation issues
   - Temporal segmentation errors

6. RECALL THRESHOLD (20/20 failed):
   - Threshold filtering not working
   - Pattern matching broken
   - Value validation issues

7. SORTING BEHAVIOR (9/9 failed):
   - Event ordering broken
   - Alphanumeric sorting issues
   - Unicode handling problems

8. API ENDPOINTS (12/21 failed):
   - Connect endpoint failures  
   - Memory management endpoints broken
   - Pattern endpoints not working
   - Cognition data issues

All Integration and Performance tests passed, indicating the high-level workflow works but core unit-level functionality is broken.

This represents a significant regression from the previous run (82 passed, 105 failed).
Current status shows fewer total failures (103 vs 105) but also fewer passes (84 vs 82).
