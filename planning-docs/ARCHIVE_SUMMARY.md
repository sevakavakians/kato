- Maintained data integrity throughout migration
- Added HNSW indexing for optimal search performance

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- **Modern FastAPI**: Direct processor embedding for better performance
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with composition pattern
- **Vector Performance**: Modern Qdrant database with HNSW indexing
- **Error Handling**: Specific exception types and explicit error reporting

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Success Rate**: 99.5% (197/198 tests passing)
- **Performance**: ~10ms average API response time
- **Code Organization**: Major refactoring reducing technical debt
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained through all changes

### Development Process
- **Planning System**: Comprehensive documentation framework implemented
- **Test Infrastructure**: Robust isolation and comprehensive coverage
- **Docker Integration**: Streamlined development and deployment
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Established baselines and monitoring

## Lessons Learned

### Architecture Decisions
- **FastAPI Migration**: Eliminated complexity while improving performance
