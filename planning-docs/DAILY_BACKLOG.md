## Today's Focus: API Endpoint Deprecation Phase 1 Complete

### Completed Today ✅

**API Endpoint Deprecation - Phase 1: Deprecation Warnings**
- ✅ Added deprecation warnings to all 6 direct endpoints
- ✅ Updated sample client with deprecation notices
- ✅ Created comprehensive API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Updated test documentation
- ✅ All planning documentation updated
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Status**: Ready for commit

### Ready to Commit

**Files Modified** (uncommitted):
```
kato/api/endpoints/kato_ops.py           (deprecation warnings)
sample-kato-client.py                     (deprecation notices)
tests/tests/api/test_fastapi_endpoints.py (documentation)
```

**Files Created** (untracked):
```
docs/API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md              (migration guide)
```

**Planning Docs Updated**:
```
planning-docs/SESSION_STATE.md           (current state)
planning-docs/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md          (detailed roadmap)
planning-docs/DECISIONS.md               (architectural decision)
planning-docs/completed/features/2025-10-06-api-deprecation-phase1.md
planning-docs/project-manager/maintenance-log.md
planning-docs/DAILY_BACKLOG.md           (this file)
```

### Next Immediate Actions

1. **Review Phase 1 Changes**
   - Verify deprecation warnings appear correctly
   - Review API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for completeness
   - Check that all endpoints remain functional

2. **Commit Phase 1**
   - Stage all modified and new files
   - Create commit with descriptive message
   - Reference the architectural decision

3. **Plan Next Phase**
   - Decide on Phase 2 timeline (auto-session middleware)
   - Consider deployment and monitoring needs
   - Communicate migration timeline to users (if applicable)

## Pending Items (Not Today)

### API Endpoint Deprecation - Future Phases

**Phase 2: Auto-Session Middleware** (3-4 hours)
- Not started
- Awaiting decision on implementation timeline
- See SPRINT_BACKLOG.md for detailed task breakdown

**Phase 3: Remove Direct Endpoints** (2-3 hours)
- Not started
- Prerequisites: Phase 2 deployed for 2-3 releases, <1% usage
- See SPRINT_BACKLOG.md for detailed task breakdown

---

## Notes

**Today's Achievement**: Successfully completed Phase 1 of API endpoint deprecation with zero breaking changes. All direct endpoints now have clear deprecation warnings and migration guidance. Users have a comprehensive migration guide to transition to session-based endpoints.

**Key Decision**: Session-based architecture with Redis persistence is superior to direct processor access. This establishes a pattern for all future KATO API development.

**No Blockers**: Phase 1 complete and ready for commit. Future phases can proceed when timeline is decided.
