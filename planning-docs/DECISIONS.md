# DECISIONS.md - Architectural & Design Decision Log
*Append-Only Log - Started: 2025-08-29*

---

## 2025-08-29 10:00 - Planning Documentation System Architecture
**Decision**: Implement planning-docs/ folder at project root with automated maintenance
**Rationale**: Need persistent context between development sessions for complex project
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single markdown file: Too limited for comprehensive planning
- Database storage: Over-engineered for documentation
- External tool integration: Adds unnecessary dependencies
**Impact**: All future development will use this system for planning and tracking
**Confidence**: High - Well-tested pattern for complex projects

---

## 2025-08-29 09:45 - Choose Container-Based Testing Approach
**Decision**: Use test-harness.sh with Docker containers for all testing
**Rationale**: Ensures consistent test environment without local Python dependencies
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Local pytest: Dependency management complexity
- GitHub Actions only: Slow feedback loop
- Virtual environments: Still has system dependency variations
**Impact**: All test commands go through test-harness.sh
**Confidence**: High - Already implemented and working

---

## 2024-12-15 - Migrate from MongoDB to Qdrant for Vector Storage
**Decision**: Replace MongoDB vector storage with Qdrant database
**Rationale**: 10-100x performance improvement with HNSW indexing
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Optimize MongoDB queries: Still linear search limitations
- Pinecone: Vendor lock-in concerns
- Weaviate: More complex setup
**Impact**: Complete rewrite of storage layer, new Docker dependency
**Confidence**: High - Benchmarks show massive improvement

---

## 2024-12-10 - Switch from gRPC to ZeroMQ
**Decision**: Replace gRPC with ZeroMQ for inter-process communication
**Rationale**: Better multiprocessing support, simpler deployment
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fix gRPC issues: Fundamental Python multiprocessing conflicts
- RabbitMQ: Heavier weight for our needs
- Direct HTTP: Performance overhead
**Impact**: Complete communication layer rewrite
**Confidence**: High - Resolved all multiprocessing issues

---

## 2024-12-01 - Implement ROUTER/DEALER Pattern
**Decision**: Use ROUTER/DEALER instead of REQ/REP for ZMQ
**Rationale**: Non-blocking operations, better scalability
**Alternatives Considered**:
- REQ/REP pattern: Blocking behavior limits throughput
- PUB/SUB: No request/response correlation
- PUSH/PULL: No bidirectional communication
**Impact**: More complex but more scalable message handling
**Confidence**: Medium-High - Standard pattern for this use case

---

## 2024-11-20 - SHA1 Hashing for Model Identification
**Decision**: Use SHA1 hashes for deterministic model identification
**Rationale**: Ensures reproducibility and model versioning
**Alternatives Considered**:
- UUID: Not deterministic for same inputs
- MD5: Collision concerns
- SHA256: Unnecessarily long for our needs
**Impact**: All models identified by MODEL|<sha1> pattern
**Confidence**: High - Works perfectly for deterministic system

---

## 2024-11-15 - FastAPI for REST Gateway
**Decision**: Use FastAPI instead of Flask for REST endpoints
**Rationale**: Async support, automatic OpenAPI docs, better performance
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flask: Less modern, no built-in async
- Django REST: Too heavyweight
- Raw ASGI: Too low-level
**Impact**: Modern async REST layer with automatic documentation
**Confidence**: High - Industry standard for Python APIs

---

## 2024-11-01 - Docker-First Development
**Decision**: Make Docker mandatory for all development and deployment
**Rationale**: Consistency across environments, easier dependency management
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Optional Docker: Environment inconsistencies
- Kubernetes: Over-complex for current scale
- Native installation: Dependency hell
**Impact**: All developers must use Docker
**Confidence**: High - Eliminates "works on my machine" issues

---

## 2024-10-15 - 768-Dimensional Vector Embeddings
**Decision**: Standardize on 768-dimensional vectors (transformer embeddings)
**Rationale**: Balance between expressiveness and performance
**Alternatives Considered**:
- 512 dimensions: Less expressive
- 1024 dimensions: Diminishing returns for performance cost
- Variable dimensions: Complexity without benefit
**Impact**: All vector operations assume 768 dimensions
**Confidence**: High - Standard for modern transformers

---

## 2024-10-01 - Deterministic Processing Requirement
**Decision**: All processing must be deterministic - same input produces same output
**Rationale**: Core requirement for explainable, debuggable AI
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Probabilistic approaches: Loses reproducibility
- Hybrid deterministic/probabilistic: Too complex
**Impact**: No random operations, careful state management
**Confidence**: Very High - Fundamental project requirement

---

## Template for New Decisions
```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - [Decision Title]
**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]
**Alternatives Considered**:
- [Option 1]: [Why rejected]
- [Option 2]: [Why rejected]
**Impact**: [Which files/components this affects]
**Confidence**: [Very High/High/Medium/Low]
```
