# PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - KATO Master Reference
*Last Updated: 2025-08-30*

## Project Identity
**Name**: KATO (Knowledge Abstraction for Traceable Outcomes)
**Vision**: Deterministic memory and prediction system for transparent, explainable AI
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - API Feature Development

## Core Purpose
KATO processes multi-modal observations (text, vectors, emotions) and makes temporal predictions while maintaining complete transparency and traceability. Every decision is deterministic and explainable.

## Tech Stack
### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Container**: Docker (required for deployment)
- **Message Queue**: ZeroMQ (ROUTER/DEALER pattern)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant with HNSW indexing
- **Cache**: Redis (for vector caching)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Testing**: pytest with fixtures

### Infrastructure
- **REST Gateway**: Port 8000 (FastAPI)
- **ZMQ Server**: Port 5555 (Internal communication)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (Docker container)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration

## Core Architecture (3-Sentence Overview)
1. REST clients communicate with a FastAPI gateway that translates HTTP requests to ZeroMQ messages
2. The ZMQ server distributes work to KATO processors which maintain working memory and coordinate with Qdrant for vector similarity searches
3. All processing is deterministic with SHA1-based model identification, ensuring reproducible predictions and complete traceability

## Success Metrics
- **Determinism**: 100% reproducible outputs for identical inputs ✅
- **Performance**: ~291x improvement with optimized pattern matching ✅
- **Test Coverage**: 128/128 tests passing (100% pass rate) ✅
- **Latency**: ~10ms average response time for standard observations ✅
- **Scalability**: Multi-instance support with processor isolation ✅

## Key Integrations
### External Dependencies
- **Qdrant**: Vector similarity search and storage
- **Redis**: High-speed vector caching layer
- **Docker**: Container orchestration and deployment

### Internal Interfaces
- **REST API**: `/observe`, `/predict`, `/ping` endpoints
- **ZMQ Protocol**: Request/Reply pattern with JSON payloads
- **Vector Operations**: 768-dimensional embeddings support

## Performance Targets
### Speed
- **Observation Processing**: < 100ms for text observations
- **Vector Search**: < 50ms for 100k vectors (Qdrant HNSW)
- **Prediction Generation**: < 500ms end-to-end

### Scale
- **Vector Capacity**: 1M+ vectors per processor
- **Concurrent Processors**: Unlimited with unique IDs
- **Request Throughput**: 1000+ req/s with pooling

### Reliability
- **Uptime Target**: 99.9% availability
- **Data Integrity**: SHA1 hashing for model verification
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and retry logic

## Recent Achievements
- **Vector DB Migration**: Successfully migrated from MongoDB to Qdrant
- **Architecture Modernization**: Replaced gRPC with ZeroMQ for better multiprocessing
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved ~291x speedup in pattern matching operations
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Removed legacy code, merged optimizations into main
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary extraction_workers, legacy test scripts

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅ - System Stabilization & Performance Optimization
- **Duration**: Multiple sessions over 2-3 days
- **Key Achievements**: 100% test pass rate, ~291x performance improvement, infrastructure stability
- **Status**: Production-ready foundation established

### Phase 2: CURRENT - API Feature Development  
- **Focus**: observe-sequence endpoint for bulk processing
- **Timeline**: Estimated 2-3 days for full implementation
- **Goal**: Enable efficient batch operations while maintaining KATO principles
- **Requirements**: Vector processing, alphanumeric sorting, comprehensive testing

### Phase 3: PLANNED - Advanced Features
- **Future Focus**: Additional API endpoints, enhanced processing capabilities
- **Dependencies**: Successful completion of Phase 2
- **Timeline**: TBD based on Phase 2 outcomes

## Current Focus Areas
1. **API Development**: observe-sequence endpoint design and implementation
2. **Batch Processing**: Efficient multi-sequence handling
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for new features
4. **Documentation**: API specification updates

## Development Philosophy
- **Determinism First**: Reproducibility over performance
- **Transparency**: Every decision must be traceable
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage before features
- **Container-Native**: All development assumes Docker environment
