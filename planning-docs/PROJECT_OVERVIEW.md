# PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - KATO Master Reference
*Last Updated: 2025-10-05*

## Project Identity
**Name**: KATO (Knowledge Abstraction for Traceable Outcomes)
**Vision**: Deterministic memory and prediction system for transparent, explainable AI
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - API Feature Development

## Core Purpose
KATO processes multi-modal observations (text, vectors, emotions) and makes temporal predictions while maintaining complete transparency and traceability. Every decision is deterministic and explainable.

## Tech Stack
### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Container**: Docker (required for deployment)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with uvicorn
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant with HNSW indexing
- **Cache**: Redis (for vector caching)
- **Database**: MongoDB for pattern storage
- **Testing**: pytest with fixtures

### Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Service**: Ports 8001-8003 (Primary/Testing/Analytics)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (Docker container)
- **MongoDB**: Pattern and metadata storage
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration

## Core Architecture (3-Sentence Overview)
1. HTTP clients communicate with FastAPI services that have embedded KATO processors for direct processing
2. Each processor maintains working memory and coordinates with MongoDB for patterns and Qdrant for vector similarity searches
3. All processing is deterministic with SHA1-based pattern identification, ensuring reproducible predictions and complete traceability

## Success Metrics
- **Determinism**: 100% reproducible outputs for identical inputs ✅
- **Performance**: ~291x improvement with optimized pattern matching ✅
- **Test Coverage**: All integration tests passing (17/17 session management, 42/42 API tests) ✅
- **Latency**: ~10ms average response time for standard observations ✅
- **Scalability**: Multi-instance support with processor isolation ✅

## Key Integrations
### External Dependencies
- **Qdrant**: Vector similarity search and storage
- **Redis**: High-speed vector caching layer
- **Docker**: Container orchestration and deployment

### Internal Interfaces
- **FastAPI Endpoints**: `/observe`, `/predictions`, `/learn`, `/health`, `/observe-sequence`
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication at `/ws`
- **Vector Operations**: 768-dimensional embeddings support

## Performance Targets
### Speed
- **Observation Processing**: < 100ms for text observations
- **Vector Search**: < 50ms for 100k vectors (Qdrant HNSW)
- **Prediction Generation**: < 500ms end-to-end

### Scale
- **Vector Capacity**: 1M+ vectors per processor
- **Concurrent Processors**: Unlimited with unique IDs
- **Request Throughput**: 1000+ req/s with pooling

### Reliability
- **Uptime Target**: 99.9% availability
- **Data Integrity**: SHA1 hashing for pattern verification
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and retry logic
