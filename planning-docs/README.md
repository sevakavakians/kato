# KATO Planning Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains planning and design documentation for the KATO (Knowledge Abstraction for Traceable Outcomes) project. The documentation is kept minimal and focused on current development needs.

## Quick Start for Development

### Essential Files (Read First)
1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Core project information and current status
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture and design decisions
3. **DECISIONS.md** - Important architectural and design decisions with rationale

### Reference Files
- **FUTURE_FEATURES.md** - Aspirational features and research ideas
- **ARCHIVE_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of completed major milestones
- **completed/** - Detailed documentation of completed work

### System Status Check
```bash
# Check KATO system status
docker-compose ps

# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# View API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Commands
```bash
# Start KATO services
./start.sh

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Build and restart
docker-compose up -d --build

# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Run specific test categories
./run_tests.sh tests/tests/unit/
./run_tests.sh tests/tests/integration/
./run_tests.sh tests/tests/api/

# View logs
docker-compose logs
docker logs kato --tail 50
```

### Service URLs (After Starting)
- **KATO Service**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Common Development Tasks

#### Making Changes
```bash
# 1. Make code changes
vim kato/workers/kato_processor.py

# 2. Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build

# 3. Run relevant tests
./run_tests.sh tests/tests/unit/test_processor.py

# 4. Run full test suite if major changes
./run_tests.sh
```

#### Adding New Features
1. Check **ARCHITECTURE.md** for design patterns
2. Implement following existing patterns
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Document decisions in **DECISIONS.md** if architectural

#### Troubleshooting
- Check service status: `docker-compose ps`
- View system logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Test basic functionality: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Run specific failing tests: `./run_tests.sh tests/tests/unit/test_failing.py`

## Current System State

**Status**: Stable and production-ready
**Architecture**: FastAPI with direct processor embedding
**Test Coverage**: 276 tests with high pass rate
**Performance**: ~10ms average response time
**Last Major Update**: Session-based architecture with observe-sequence endpoint

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows a "minimal and current" approach:
- **Essential information only** - No outdated or aspirational content mixed with current facts
- **Clear separation** - Historical work in archives, future ideas in dedicated files
- **Developer-focused** - Practical information for getting work done
- **Self-maintaining** - Simple structure that doesn't require constant updates

*Keep this documentation clean, current, and focused on what developers actually need.*
