# SESSION_STATE.md - Live Development Status
*Last Updated: 2025-08-29 - Session Complete*

## Current Task
**Feature/Bug**: Planning Documentation System Implementation - COMPLETED
**Component**: Project Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Started**: 2025-08-29
**Completed**: 2025-08-29

## Progress
**Overall**: 100% Complete (Planning System) | 80% Complete (Session Goals)
- [x] Folder structure created
- [x] Core documents initialized
- [x] CLAUDE.md integration
- [x] Agent configuration
- [x] Session tracking initialized
- [x] Test infrastructure fixes completed
- [x] File review and commits completed
- [x] Full test suite verification (128 tests passing)
- [x] Final testing and usage examples completed
- [x] USAGE_EXAMPLES.md created with comprehensive examples
- [!] Performance optimizations attempted but reverted due to IndexManager issues

## Session Accomplishments
1. **COMPLETED**: Fixed test-harness.sh execution issue - Changed PROJECT_ROOT to KATO_ROOT in kato-manager.sh
2. **COMPLETED**: Reviewed and committed all modified files - Fixed paths and added planning docs
3. **COMPLETED**: Successfully ran full test suite - All 128 tests passing in 46.13 seconds
4. **COMPLETED**: Planning documentation system 100% complete with usage examples
5. **BLOCKED**: Performance optimizations caused test failures - reverted to maintain stability

## Active Files (Session Complete)
- All planning documentation files created and tested
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated with planning protocols)
- Session log completed: `sessions/2025-08-29-102917.md`
- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` created for planning system reference

## Next Session Actions
1. **Priority 1**: Fix IndexManager initialization in model_search_optimized.py
2. **Priority 2**: Debug why OptimizedModelSearcher causes 500 errors
3. **Priority 3**: Re-enable optimizations after fixing issues
4. **Priority 4**: Run performance benchmarks once working

## Current Blockers
- **Performance Optimization Issue**: OptimizedModelSearcher has IndexManager initialization problems causing test failures
- **Technical**: Need to resolve "AttributeError: 'IndexManager' object has no attribute 'model_hashes'" before enabling optimizations

## Context Stack (Session Summary)
1. **SUCCESS**: Planning documentation system fully implemented and tested (100% complete)
2. **SUCCESS**: Test infrastructure fully operational with all 128 tests passing
3. **SUCCESS**: Git repository clean with all changes properly committed
4. **ISSUE**: Performance optimizations in TODO-OPTIMIZATION-ACTIVATE.md need debugging
5. **DISCOVERY**: IndexManager class has initialization issues preventing optimization activation
6. **DECISION**: Reverted optimization changes to maintain system stability

## Session Metrics
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Efficiency**: Excellent (4 of 5 major goals completed)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (128/128 tests)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive planning system established

## Energy Level
**High** - Beginning of session, clear objectives

## Session Notes
- Implementing comprehensive planning system for better session continuity
- Focus on KATO-specific workflows and architecture
- Leveraging existing tools (kato-manager.sh, test-harness.sh)
