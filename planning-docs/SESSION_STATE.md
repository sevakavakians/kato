## Current Task
**API Endpoint Deprecation - ALL PHASES COMPLETE**
- Status: ✅ PROJECT COMPLETED
- Started: 2025-10-06
- Completed: 2025-10-06
- Total Effort: 7 hours (estimate: 7.5h, 93% accuracy)

## Progress
- Phase 1 (Deprecation Warnings): ✅ 100% Complete (1h)
- Phase 2 (Auto-Session Middleware): ✅ 100% Complete (4h)
- Phase 3 (Endpoint Removal): ✅ 100% Complete (2h)

## Active Files
None - Project complete, all changes committed

## Next Immediate Action
API migration project complete. System now operates with clean session-only architecture:
1. All deprecated endpoints removed (return 404)
2. Auto-session middleware removed
3. All utility endpoints remain functional
4. Documentation updated to reflect session-only API

## Blockers
None - Project successfully completed

## Context
The API Endpoint Deprecation project successfully migrated KATO from a duplicate API architecture (direct + session-based endpoints) to a single, robust session-based API. All three phases completed on 2025-10-06:
- Phase 1: Added deprecation warnings (backward compatible)
- Phase 2: Auto-session middleware for transparent migration
- Phase 3: Complete removal of deprecated code (~900 lines removed)

System now has clean session-only architecture with superior state management via Redis persistence and explicit session locking.

## Key Metrics
- Total Files Modified: 10
- Total Lines Removed: 1,223
- Total Lines Added: 787
- Net Code Reduction: -436 lines
- Breaking Changes: Phase 3 only (expected, documented)
- Test Pass Rate: 100%
