## Phase 2 Target Files (Starting)
- `/Users/sevakavakians/PROGRAMMING/kato/kato/services/kato_fastapi.py` (add observe-sequence endpoint)
- `/Users/sevakavakians/PROGRAMMING/kato/kato/workers/kato_processor.py` (bulk sequence processing logic)
- `/Users/sevakavakians/PROGRAMMING/kato/tests/tests/api/` (new test suite for bulk endpoint)
- API documentation and schema files

## Phase 2 Action Plan
1. **Priority 1**: Design observe-sequence endpoint API specification
2. **Priority 2**: Implement bulk sequence processing in kato_processor.py  
3. **Priority 3**: Add endpoint in kato_fastapi.py
4. **Priority 4**: Create comprehensive test suite
5. **Priority 5**: Update API documentation

## Current Status
- **System Health**: STABLE ✅
- **Architecture**: FastAPI Migration Complete ✅
- **Test Suite**: 183/185 tests passing (98.9% pass rate) ✅ 
- **Core API Endpoints**: All functional in FastAPI
