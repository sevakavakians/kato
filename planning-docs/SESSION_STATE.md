## Next Immediate Action
Phase 1 work is complete and ready for commit. Next steps:

None - Phase 1 complete, awaiting decision on Phase 2 timeline

## Context
The API Endpoint Deprecation project aims to migrate KATO from a duplicate API architecture (direct + session-based endpoints) to a single, robust session-based API. Phase 1 adds deprecation warnings to all direct endpoints while maintaining full backward compatibility. Future phases will add automatic migration support and eventually remove the deprecated endpoints entirely.

## Key Metrics
- Files Modified: 4
- Files Created: 1 (API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- Test Coverage: All existing tests passing
- Breaking Changes: None (backward compatible)
