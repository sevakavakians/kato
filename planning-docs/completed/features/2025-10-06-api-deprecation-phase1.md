# API Endpoint Deprecation - Phase 1: Deprecation Warnings

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-06
**Category**: Feature - API Migration
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Phase 1 of the API Endpoint Deprecation project adds deprecation warnings to all direct (header-based) KATO endpoints while maintaining full backward compatibility. This is the first step in migrating to a session-based-only API architecture.

## Problem Statement

KATO had two parallel API architectures:

1. **Direct Endpoints** (Original):
   - Access via processor_id query parameter or X-Node-ID header
   - State stored in processor cache only
   - No persistence layer
   - Vulnerable to cache evictions
   - Less robust for multi-user scenarios

2. **Session-Based Endpoints** (Improved):
   - Access via explicit session_id
   - State stored in Redis with persistence
   - Explicit session locking for concurrency
   - Proper TTL and lifecycle management
   - Superior multi-user isolation

This duplication caused:
- User confusion about which endpoints to use
- Maintenance burden supporting two architectures
- Documentation complexity
- Inconsistent state management patterns

## Solution

Add deprecation warnings to all direct endpoints, guiding users to migrate to session-based alternatives while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Updated Direct Endpoint Handlers (`kato/api/endpoints/kato_ops.py`)

Added deprecation warnings and migration guidance to:
- `/observe` (observe_primary)
- `/stm`, `/short-term-memory` (get_stm_primary)
- `/learn` (learn_primary)
- `/predictions` (get_predictions_primary)
- `/clear-stm`, `/clear-short-term-memory` (clear_stm_primary)
- `/clear-all` (clear_all_primary)

Each endpoint now:
- Logs deprecation warning with recommended alternative
- Shows deprecation notice in docstring visible in `/docs`
- Maintains full functionality (no breaking changes)

**Example Warning**:
```
⚠️  DEPRECATED: This direct endpoint is deprecated. Use session-based endpoints instead:
    POST /sessions/{session_id}/observe
```

#### 2. Updated Sample Client (`sample-kato-client.py`)

Added deprecation notices to all direct methods:
- `observe()` → use `observe_in_session()`
- `get_stm()` → use `get_session_stm()`
- `learn()` → use `learn_in_session()`
- `get_predictions()` → use `get_session_predictions()`
- `clear_stm()` → use `clear_session_stm()`
- `clear_all()` → use `clear_session_all()`

Each method retains functionality but warns users about deprecation.

#### 3. Created Migration Guide (`docs/API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)

Comprehensive 200+ line guide including:
- **Why Migrate**: Benefits of session-based architecture
- **Migration Timeline**: 3-phase approach
- **Quick Reference**: Side-by-side code examples for all endpoints
- **Session Management**: Lifecycle best practices
- **Common Patterns**: Multi-observation workflows
- **FAQ**: Addressing migration concerns

#### 4. Updated Test Documentation (`tests/tests/api/test_fastapi_endpoints.py`)

Added comments documenting:
- Current test coverage of both direct and session-based endpoints
- Which tests will be updated in future phases
- Expected behavior during migration phases

## Files Modified

```
kato/api/endpoints/kato_ops.py           (Added deprecation warnings)
sample-kato-client.py                     (Added deprecation notices)
tests/tests/api/test_fastapi_endpoints.py (Updated documentation)
```

## Files Created

```
docs/API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md              (Comprehensive migration guide)
```

## Testing

- All existing tests pass (no breaking changes)
- Deprecation warnings appear in logs as expected
- Both direct and session-based endpoints remain functional
- API documentation at `/docs` shows deprecation notices

## Migration Path

### Phase 1 (COMPLETED): Deprecation Warnings
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Impact: Zero breaking changes
- User action: Awareness, begin planning migration

### Phase 2 (Planned): Auto-Session Middleware
- Status: Not started
- Impact: Automatic backward compatibility
- User action: Migration recommended but not required
- Estimated: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3 (Future): Endpoint Removal
- Status: Not started
- Prerequisites: 2-3 releases after Phase 2, <1% deprecated endpoint usage
- Impact: Breaking change for unmigrated users
- User action: Must migrate to session-based endpoints
- Estimated: 2-3 hours

## Benefits Achieved

1. **User Awareness**: Clear communication about upcoming changes
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive migration guidance available
3. **Zero Disruption**: Full backward compatibility maintained
4. **Clear Path**: Well-defined migration timeline
5. **Foundation**: Groundwork for Phase 2 and 3

## Technical Decisions

1. **Maintain Full Compatibility**: No breaking changes in Phase 1
2. **Visible Warnings**: Both in logs and API documentation
3. **Comprehensive Guide**: Reduce migration friction with detailed examples
4. **Phased Approach**: Allow time for user migration (3 phases over multiple releases)

## Related Work

- **Session Architecture Transformation Phase 1** (2025-09-26): Established session-based architecture
- **Session Architecture Transformation Phase 2** (2025-10-03): Multi-user session isolation
- **Technical Debt Cleanup Phases 1-5** (2024-2025): Improved code quality foundation

## Next Steps

When ready to proceed:

1. **Commit Phase 1 changes** to main branch
2. **Deploy and monitor** deprecation warning frequency
3. **Communicate timeline** to users (if applicable)
4. **Plan Phase 2** when ready for auto-migration middleware

## Key Takeaways

- Session-based architecture is superior for state management
- Redis persistence prevents state loss from cache evictions
- Explicit locking ensures thread safety
- Phased deprecation minimizes user disruption
- Comprehensive documentation reduces migration friction
