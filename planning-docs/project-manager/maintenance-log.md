   - Problem statement and solution approach
   - Implementation details for all modified endpoints
   - Migration path with 3-phase timeline
   - Benefits, technical decisions, and related work

**Phase 1 Summary**:
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Files Modified**: 4
  - `kato/api/endpoints/kato_ops.py` (deprecation warnings)
  - `sample-kato-client.py` (deprecation notices)
  - `tests/tests/api/test_fastapi_endpoints.py` (documentation)
- **Files Created**: 1
  - `docs/API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive 200+ line guide)

**Endpoints Deprecated**:
- `/observe` → `/sessions/{session_id}/observe`
- `/stm`, `/short-term-memory` → `/sessions/{session_id}/stm`
- `/learn` → `/sessions/{session_id}/learn`
- `/predictions` → `/sessions/{session_id}/predictions`
- `/clear-stm`, `/clear-short-term-memory` → `/sessions/{session_id}/clear-stm`
- `/clear-all` → `/sessions/{session_id}/clear-all`

**Migration Rationale**:
- Session-based: Redis persistence, explicit locking, TTL management
- Direct endpoints: Processor cache only, no persistence, cache eviction risk
- Single API path reduces confusion and maintenance burden

**Future Phases**:
- **Phase 2** (Not started): Auto-session middleware for backward compatibility
  - Estimated: 3-4 hours
  - Creates implicit sessions for direct endpoint calls
  - Adds metrics tracking for deprecation usage
- **Phase 3** (Not started): Remove direct endpoints entirely
  - Estimated: 2-3 hours
  - Prerequisites: 2-3 releases after Phase 2, <1% deprecated endpoint usage
  - Breaking change with comprehensive migration support

**Files Modified by Agent**:
- Created: `planning-docs/SESSION_STATE.md`
- Created: `planning-docs/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md`
- Updated: `planning-docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Created: `planning-docs/completed/features/2025-10-06-api-deprecation-phase1.md`
- Updated: `planning-docs/project-manager/maintenance-log.md` (this file)

**Context Preserved**:
- Complete 3-phase migration plan documented
- Detailed task breakdowns for future phases
- All file changes tracked
- Zero breaking changes in Phase 1 (fully backward compatible)
- Success criteria defined for each phase
- Metrics-based decision criteria for Phase 3

**Project Status**:
- Phase 1 complete and ready for commit
- Deprecation warnings active in logs and API docs
- Comprehensive migration guide available for users
- Clear path forward for Phases 2 and 3

**Next Recommended Actions**:
1. Commit Phase 1 changes to main branch
2. Deploy and monitor deprecation warning frequency
3. Plan Phase 2 implementation when ready for auto-migration
4. Wait 2-3 releases after Phase 2 before considering Phase 3

**Key Takeaway**: Session-based architecture with Redis persistence is superior to direct processor cache access. All future KATO endpoints should be session-based from the start.
