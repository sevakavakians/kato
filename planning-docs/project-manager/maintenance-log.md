- **Updated SESSION_STATE.md**: Marked optimization deployment complete, set next priorities
- **Updated DAILY_BACKLOG.md**: Refreshed with post-optimization priorities (3 test failures)
- **Updated SPRINT_BACKLOG.md**: Marked test suite optimization completed early with major gains
- **System status**: Changed from CRITICAL to STABLE - all core endpoints functional
- **Test recovery**: Improved from 34% to 97.7% pass rate (125/128 tests)
- **Code cleanup**: Legacy optimized files removed, main implementation updated

- **Updated session metrics**: Added bug fix duration (~45 minutes) to historical performance data
- **Created detailed archive**: `completed/bugs/2025-09-01-division-by-zero-bug-fix.md` with full analysis
- **Updated DAILY_BACKLOG.md**: Added critical bug fix as completed task with detailed results
- **Updated phase status**: Changed Phase 2 from "STARTING" to "RESUMING" after critical interruption
- **Enhanced phase transition summary**: Added bug fix completion to development timeline
- **Key fixes documented**: Pattern fragmentation, ITFDF similarity, hamiltonian calculations, MongoDB metadata
- **Error handling philosophy**: Documented shift from masking to explicit error reporting
- **Test status confirmed**: All tests passing (100% pass rate maintained)
