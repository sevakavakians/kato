## Current Issues

## 2026-09-09 - Release Version Bump Decision Needed (Breaking API Change, Not Yet Released)
**Issue**: DECISION-019 (`planning-docs/DECISIONS.md`) redefines the `anomalies` prediction field (flat deviation list) and adds a new `fuzzy_matches` field, moving the `{observed, expected, similarity}` fuzzy-match detail out of `anomalies`. This is a breaking change for any API consumer currently reading fuzzy-match details from `anomalies`. Nothing from this work has been committed yet.
**Impact**: If released as-is per this repo's semver workflow (see `CLAUDE.md` "Container Manager Workflow Protocol"), this would warrant a **major** version bump, not patch/minor — but that call was deliberately left to the user rather than made unilaterally by the agent doing the code work.
**Suggested Action**: Decide (a) whether to release this change at all in its current form, (b) if released, confirm a major version bump via `./container-manager.sh major "..."`, and (c) whether any deprecation/compatibility shim for `anomalies` consumers is warranted before release.
**Priority**: Medium — not urgent (nothing committed or released yet), but should be resolved before this work is committed/released so it isn't accidentally shipped as a patch/minor bump.
**Status**: Open

## Resolved Issues

## 2026-09-09 - Cross-Worker WebSocket Broadcaster Fix: Priority Decision Needed — RESOLVED
**Issue (as originally filed)**: DECISION-020 confirmed deterministically that `kato/websocket/event_broadcaster.py`'s in-process `EventBroadcaster` cannot deliver websocket events across uvicorn workers at `KATO_WORKERS=2`/`4` (the container's default). The fix had not been started and needed a human priority decision before the next release.
**Resolution**: The fix was requested and completed the same day (2026-09-09), committed as `ba3d194`. `EventBroadcaster.broadcast_event` now publishes to a Redis pub/sub channel (`kato:ws_events`); every uvicorn worker subscribes at startup and delivers received events to its own local connections, giving exactly-once delivery per client with no locks. See DECISION-021 (`planning-docs/DECISIONS.md`) and `planning-docs/completed/features/2026-09-09-websocket-cross-worker-broadcaster-redis-pubsub.md`.
**Verification**: New `tests/tests/unit/test_event_broadcaster.py` (6 tests) plus the existing `tests/tests/integration/test_worker_topology.py`, now passing 15/15 across `KATO_WORKERS` in {1, 2, 4} (previously 6 deterministic failures at {2, 4}). Full suite: 475 passed / 4 skipped / 0 failed.
**Note**: This resolves only the websocket-delivery half of the broader "Bug: Multi-worker (KATO_WORKERS=4) breaks websocket event delivery and concurrent session modification consistency" backlog entry. The separate `test_concurrent_session_modifications` concurrent-write-loss symptom is **not** addressed by this fix and remains open — see `planning-docs/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md`.
**Resolved**: 2026-09-09
