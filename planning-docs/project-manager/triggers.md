## 2026-04-20 - New Specifications (Multi-Worker Uvicorn + Concurrent Training Safety)

**Trigger Type**: Primary — New Specifications + Context Switch
**Event**: Approved implementation plan for multi-worker uvicorn support; prior distributed-lock draft rejected
**Source**: User — plan file at `/Users/sevakavakians/.claude/plans/ultrathink-enable-multi-worker-recursive-marble.md`

**Plan Summary**:
- Change 1: `KATO_WORKERS` env var wired into Dockerfile, both compose files, and kato-manager.sh `--workers N` flag
- Change 2: `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE=1` + ClickHouse `async_insert=1, wait_for_async_insert=1` — eliminates per-worker buffer orphan at finalize
- Change 3: SETNX gate in `learnPattern` + `write_metadata(frequency=None)` — closes duplicate row, double-increment, and SET-clobbers-INCR races

**Rejected approach noted**: Distributed session locks were in the prior draft. Explicitly out of scope — training never accesses the same session concurrently.

**Documentation Actions**:
- Updated: `planning-docs/SESSION_STATE.md` (current task, next action)
- Updated: `planning-docs/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md` (new active item at top)
- Updated: `planning-docs/project-manager/maintenance-log.md`
- Updated: `planning-docs/project-manager/triggers.md` (this entry)

**Trigger Type**: Primary — Task Completion
**Event**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation issues fixed; all 36 endpoints now have response_model=; version corrected; routing conflict resolved; deprecated endpoints marked
**Source**: Developer report — 5 new schema files, 28 new Pydantic models, route reordering, dynamic version import
