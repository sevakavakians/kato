## Test Status at Release

### Overall Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 388
- **Passing**: 385
- **Failing**: 3 (2 known stress test issues + 1 pre-existing)
- **Pass Rate**: 99.2%

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **test_dozens_of_patterns_persistence** - Stress test edge case
2. **test_rolling_mode_memory_efficiency** - Stress test edge case
3. Pre-existing failure in test_rolling_window_integration.py (unrelated to v3.0.2 changes)

### Release Decision
**Status**: APPROVED - Proceeded with release
**Rationale**:
- Core functionality tests: 100% passing
- Stress test failures are edge cases in non-critical paths
- Failures documented for future patch consideration
- No regression in core features
- Production deployments unaffected
