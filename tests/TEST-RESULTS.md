- `test_threshold_boundary_values`
**Issue:** Recall threshold logic not behaving as expected - returning same number of predictions regardless of threshold

**2. Comprehensive Sequences Tests (6+ failures)**
- Various comprehensive sequence tests failing
**Issue:** Complex sequence scenarios still not generating expected predictions

**3. Edge Case Tests (remaining failures)**
- Various edge case scenarios
**Issue:** Specific edge cases in prediction generation

**4. Memory Management Tests (some remaining)**

- ✅ **Optimization Tests:** All passing (5/5)

## Performance Analysis

**Total Execution Time:** 59.10 seconds for 194 tests (average ~0.30 seconds per test)

**Performance Improvements:**
- Increased test coverage: 194 tests (up from 133)
- Maintained execution speed: 0.30s average per test
- All optimization flags working correctly
- Vector database performance optimized with Qdrant

**Test Execution Efficiency:**
The performance optimizations continue to work effectively. The slight increase in total time is due to 61 additional tests being executed, while maintaining similar per-test execution speed.

## Code Quality Metrics

**Static Analysis:** No static analysis warnings reported
**Test Coverage:** Not explicitly measured in this run
**Code Standards:** All tests follow established patterns and fixtures

## Root Cause Analysis - MAJOR SUCCESS!
